# 'My News Bubble' App Proposal

## What is 'My News Bubble'?

'My News Bubble' is an app in which users can register and create a unqiue profile of their favorite news sources.

When a user logs in, the app will list over a dozen major news sources to choose from. The user simply has to click an 'add' button to add the news source to that users 'bubble'.

The user can always go back to the user's 'bubble' (profile) and remove a news source later.

The heart of the app is the user's news feed, which will include the top news stories from the user's selected favorite news sources.
